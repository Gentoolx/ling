 * @mainpage Wintermute Linguistics (WntrLing)
 * Wintermute uses an unique blend of natural language processing learning utilities,
 * some of which are similar to already existing projects (such as LinkGrammar at OpenCog
 * or Panlingua by Chamount Devin). The natural language processing used here is an adaptive,
 * link-based approach. By using an externally defined set of rules and an external list
 * of words with each of its tenses and variations linked to an ontology concept; it's
 * possible for WntrLing to form ontological representation of natural text. This, in turn,
 * provides an immediate form of natural language processing.D
