The code in this directory all pertains to Wintermute's ability to process
natural language. In order to use any of the languages, you must first build
'wintermute-linguistics-core' as it provides the boilerplate code for NLP.

See 'INSTALL' for build and install instructions.
See the 'TODO' and 'HACKING' documents within each folder for pointers on where to
	assist.
